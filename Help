Welcome to the Circuit Manual!
Circuit is an open source Discord Moderation and server Management bot designed to make managing a server that much easier.
Circuit requires a JSON file with the title of m.json with the contents including your ID and bot token. This is used throughout
the project and will be necessary for the bot to work. Any further questions can be handled in the support discord, linked below.
Thank you for using Circuit!
